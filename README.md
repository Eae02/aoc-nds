To compile, make sure you have devkitarm and libnds installed, then run `./compile.sh`.

Input files can either be compiled into the binary or stored in a folder called `inp` next to the binary (this does not work in emulators).
If a folder called `inp` exists at compile time, the inputs from this folder will be compiled into the binary.
The input files should be named `{day}.txt`. `download_inputs.py` will download your inputs and place them in the `inp` folder.
